There is one directory for each of the five sets of ethanol FEP simulations. Each is run using 16 lambda states.
In the first stage 1 ns is run, starting from the output of the previous state to chain the simulations and thereby
reducing the need of equilibration. After that, the simulations are extended to 19 ns.
The simulations are run by executing
./runscript.sh
in each of the sets of simulations.
